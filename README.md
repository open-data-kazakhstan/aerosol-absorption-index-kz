# Aerosol Absorption Index in Kazakhstan

## Introduction

This repository contains code and data for visualizing the aerosol absorption index in various regions of Kazakhstan over the years. The visualization includes a bar chart race and an animated map to provide a comprehensive view of the atmospheric pollutants' emissions.

## Code

### Dependencies

Make sure to install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas bar_chart_race
```

## Data
The dataset (Pollution.csv) includes information about the aerosol absorption index in different regions of Kazakhstan from 2017 to 2022.

Columns:
- year: The year of the data
- Region-wise columns: Aerosol absorption index values for each region

## Running the Code

Run the provided Python script (code.py) to generate the visualizations. The script uses bar_chart_race library for creating a bar chart race. The script uses bar_chart_race library for creating a bar chart race.

```bash
python code.py
```

The generated bar chart race will be saved as Pol_bar_race.mp4 in the current directory.

# Visualization
## Bar Chart Race
The bar chart race visually represents the changes in aerosol absorption index over the years for each region in Kazakhstan. Parameters such as title, orientation, sorting, and color mapping have been customized to enhance the visual experience.

## Animated Map
The animated map provides a dynamic representation of the aerosol absorption index on a geographical map of Kazakhstan. This additional visualization adds context to the regional variations in pollution levels.

## Conclusion
Explore the visualizations to gain insights into the trends and patterns of aerosol absorption index in different regions of Kazakhstan from 2017 to 2022. The combination of bar chart race and animated map offers a comprehensive understanding of the atmospheric pollution scenario in the country.
